#PHP File Search

Searches for a string in all files within a selected directory.

This program uses GNU grep where possible. As an alternative it will use my own implementation of the Boyer Moore search algorithm.

Instructions:

1. Upload search directory to any location within the webroot (you may wish to change the name of the dir for security).
2. Set a password in the config file.
2. Navigate to search e.g. http://www.yourdomain.com/search/.
3. Enter search details.
